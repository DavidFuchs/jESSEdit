{"name":"jESSedit","tagline":"A Java-based save-game API and editor client for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.","body":"jESSEdit\r\n========\r\n\r\nA Java-based save-game API for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\r\n\r\nI wrote this API because I was interested in cleaning my save games in Skyrim.  While I never actually got to the\r\npart where I could clean my games with it, I did complete the API insofar as reading and writing Skyrim save game\r\nfiles (ESS files).  As such, I leave it as an exercise for other developers to take this API and do something useful\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport ca.davidfuchs.jessedit.ess.*;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(\"savegame.ess\");\r\nESSFile essFile = ESSReader.readESSFile(inputStream);\r\n\r\n// Do some work on the ESSFile object...\r\n\r\nOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(\"savegame2.ess\");\r\nESSWriter.writeESSFile(outputStream, essFile);\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nCommand-Line Usage\r\n==================\r\n\r\njESSEdit is primarily an API, but comes with a command-line application that prints the header section\r\nof the ESS file, more or less to act as a proof of concept that it can read the file.\r\n\r\n**Note:** You may need to adjust this command, as the JAR file may have a different version number.\r\n\r\n```\r\njava -jar jESSEdit-app-0.1.jar --file /path/to/savegame.ess\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
